Gallagher Gold Price Prediction
================================

## Project Description
This project aims to predict global gold prices using time series forecasting techniques. Various models, including LSTM, MLP(NN), ARIMA, ETS, and Prophet, were explored to identify the best-performing model. The model leverages macroeconomic indicators such as S&P 500, Oil Crude prices, and the US Dollar Index to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Dataset Explanation
The dataset consists of historical gold prices along with macroeconomic indicators:
- **Gold Price**: The target variable, measured in USD per ounce.
- **Oil Crude**: Crude oil prices in USD per barrel.
- **US Dollar Index**: Measures the strength of the USD against a basket of currencies.
- **S&P 500**: Represents the stock market index value.

Time span: **2014-01-02 to 2025-02-28** (11 years, 2804 observations).

## Model Insights
- LSTM with log-transformed gold prices and S&P 500 achieved the best performance (RMSE = 0.028).
- Incorporating macroeconomic factors significantly improved model accuracy.
- The project highlights the potential of deep learning in financial forecasting.
